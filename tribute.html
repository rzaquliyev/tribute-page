                   <strong> Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin </strong> was a Russian revolutionary anarchist, socialist and 
                   founder of collectivist anarchism.  He is considered among the most influential figures of anarchism and a major founder of 
                   the revolutionary socialist and social anarchist tradition.  Bakunin's prestige as a revolutionary 
                   also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.

                    <strong> "...the People's State so strongly commended by Marx, and the aristocratic-monarchic State, 
                    maintained with as much cleverness as power by Bismarck, are completely identical by the 
                    nature of their objective at home as well as in foreign affairs.</strong> In foreign affairs it is 
                    the same deployment of military force, that is to say, conquest; and in home affairs it is 
                    the same employment of this armed force, the last argument of all threatened political powers
                    against the masses, who, tired of believing, hoping, submitting and obeying always, rise in revolt." <br >

                     hangs over his head and over his family, will force him to accept any conditions imposed by 
                     the gainful calculations of the capitalist, the industrialist, the employer."
